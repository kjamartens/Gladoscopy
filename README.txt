Work-in-progress of autonomous microscopy by Koen J.A. Martens at Endesfelder lab, Bonn Germany, 2023-

Core concept: score cells based on arbitrary parameters after segmentation, then score FoVs based on these cell scores, then score combination of FoVs. Use this info to decide which FoVs to image at what time points.

Also contains a GUI for laser-control of the 'Glados' microscope (functional via Micromanager, triggerscope)

Runs mainly via virtual environment in .venv folder. Written in Python.
